Re: [exact keyword from journalist's request] — quote from ex-AFFiNE COO
```

## Body

```
Hi [Journalist Name, or "Reporter" if unknown],

I'm Iris Wei, ex-COO of AFFiNE (60k+ GitHub stars, 30x Product Hunt #1
winner across 2020-2026). For your question on [TOPIC]:

[3-SENTENCE ANSWER — structure:
 1. Lead with a number ("In our 30-launch dataset...")
 2. Give the mechanism ("...we found X correlates 4x more than Y")
 3. End with takeaway ("...so the practical move is Z")]

If you need a longer quote, follow-up data, or a screenshot from
our analytics, happy to share.

 No expectation of a link in your article — providing this quote because the
 data is unique and the topic matches my domain.]

### SEO / GEO / AI search

### B2B SaaS growth
> "From running PLG / SLG hybrid playbooks for AFFiNE, the under-discussed pattern is..."

### Indie hacking / 0→1

## Quote rate optimization (what bumps you from 5% → 25%)

| Signal | Multiplier |
|---|---|
| **Specific number** in first sentence | 2x |
| **Personal anecdote** (not generic advice) | 1.5x |
| **Credential in signature** (ex-AFFiNE COO) | 1.5x |
| **Disclosure paragraph** (transparency) | 1.2x |
| **Response within 4 hours** of HARO email | 2x |
| **Niche match** (don't reach for off-topic) | 3x |

Combine all 6 → ~25% quote rate. That's the upper bound for inbound expert quotes.

## What NOT to send

- ❌ Generic advice ("Make sure your content is high quality")
- ❌ Marketing pitch ("Our tool solves this")
- ❌ Vague claims ("Many startups find that...")
- ❌ Long backstory before the answer
- ❌ Multiple URLs (looks SEO-spammy → journalist filters out)
- ❌ Bullet points (HARO expects prose)
