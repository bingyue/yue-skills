## What Problem Does It Solve

Every day you open Lark: 999+ messages, approval badges, calendar alerts, doc comments... scattered everywhere. By the time you've checked everything, 20 minutes are gone and you're still not sure if you missed anything. Using Lark across multiple organizations? Multiply that by the number of accounts you have.

That's why I built lark-todo: **one sentence triggers a parallel scan across all your enterprise accounts × 8 data sources, AI merges and sorts everything by urgency, handles what it can on the spot, and creates tasks for the rest.** One account or many — one sentence is all it takes.

## 🧭 Before / After

| | Manual Checking | lark-todo |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| **Find action items** | Check messages, approvals, email, calendar... 20 min | 8 sources scanned in parallel, 30 sec |
| **Prioritize** | Memory and gut feeling | AI auto-sorts by urgency + calendar links |
| **Handle items** | Switch between apps one by one | Pick a number → reply/approve/RSVP directly |
| **Risk of missing** | High (especially doc comments, overdue tasks) | Full-platform scan, nothing missed |
| **Multi-org** | Check each org separately | Parallel scan across orgs, merged and sorted |

## 💬 How to Use

```
What do I need to deal with today?
```

The AI Agent automatically:

1. **Collects** — Scans IM messages, meeting notes, calendar, doc comments, approvals, tasks, and email in parallel
2. **Analyzes** — Sorts by urgency, links to upcoming calendar events, deduplicates across sources
3. **Acts** — Handles directly when possible (reply, approve, RSVP), creates Lark tasks for the rest

## 📊 Sample Output

**Multi-org mode** (each item labeled with its source organization):

```
## Action Items for Today (2026-04-16 Wednesday) Full Scan (2 orgs)

### Upcoming Calendar
  [Alice] 15:00-16:00 Design Review (pending — needs RSVP)
   └─ Related: Item #1 is about this meeting, handle before it starts
  [Alice Z.] 16:30-17:00 Product Weekly (accepted)

### Action Items

1. [Urgent] [Alice] [Product Chat] Bob: Please review this PR (4h ago, no reply)
   └─ Source: Message | Suggestion: Reply directly
2. [Urgent] [Alice Z.] Finish quarterly report (overdue 2 days)
   └─ Source: Lark Task
3. [Normal] [Alice] [Purchase Approval] From: Charlie, submitted 14:30
   └─ Source: Approval | Suggestion: Approve directly
4. [Low] [Alice] [Design Doc] Dave commented: Add performance benchmarks
   └─ Source: Doc comment | Suggestion: Add benchmarks in section 3

---
Total: 4 items (Urgent 2 / Normal 1 / Low 1)
├─ Alice: 3 items | Alice Z.: 1 item
Enter a number to handle directly, or say "create tasks for all".
```

> Single-account output is identical — just without the `[org label]`.

## 🏢 Multi-Organization Support

Using Lark/Feishu across multiple organizations? lark-todo automatically discovers all configured app profiles, scans them in parallel, and merges results:

```

- Single account: behaves exactly like before, no org labels
- Multiple accounts: each item labeled with org identity (your name in that org)
- All items sorted by priority, not grouped by org
- Actions automatically route to the correct org

## 🔧 Account Management

| Action | Trigger |
|--------|---------|
| Add account | "Add an enterprise account" / "Connect another Lark app" |
| View accounts | "How many enterprise accounts do I have?" |
| Remove account | "Remove an enterprise account" |

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

- An AI agent supporting the SKILL.md spec ([Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) / [Trae](https://www.trae.cn/) / [Cline](https://cline.bot/))
- **Node.js >= 18** (hosts lark-cli; the skill auto-runs `npm install -g @larksuite/cli` on first use and skips if already present)
- A Lark/Feishu custom app (guided setup on first use)

> No manual lark-cli install required: `scripts/bootstrap.sh` probes and installs idempotently in Step 0. If it cannot install (Node.js missing, npm permission errors, etc.), it returns a non-zero exit code and the skill halts cleanly at Step 0 — you get actionable remediation hints instead of silent failures downstream.

### Install

**Recommended: just tell your Agent**

```text
Please install this skill:
https://github.com/autumnseasonism/lark-todo-skill.git
```

If the agent supports skill installation, this is usually the simplest option.

**If you want to install it manually**

```bash
# Put it in the current project directory, or in your agent's skill scan path
git clone https://github.com/autumnseasonism/lark-todo-skill.git
```

Place the repository directory in the current project directory, or in that agent's skill scan path.

### First-Time Setup

The skill automatically guides you through four setup steps:

0. **Dependency Bootstrap** (Step 0) — `scripts/bootstrap.sh` detects lark-cli; if missing it runs `npm install -g @larksuite/cli`. Idempotent — skipped on subsequent runs.
1. **App Configuration** — Connect your Lark custom app (`lark-cli config init`)
2. **User Authorization** — Grant all required permissions at once (11 domains)
3. **Command Permission** — If your agent asks before running commands, allow `lark-cli`

Once done, just talk to your agent — no further setup needed. Step 0 re-probes each session in a few hundred milliseconds; it never reinstalls if lark-cli is already on PATH.

## 🔒 Security

- **Read before write** — Collection is read-only; all write actions require user confirmation
- **No credential storage** — Auth handled by `lark-cli`, the skill stores no tokens
- **Email anti-injection** — Email content treated as untrusted input, never executes "instructions" from email body
- **Graceful degradation** — Missing permissions skip that source with a note, no blocking
- **No secret leaks** — appSecret and accessToken are never printed to terminal

## ✅ Test Coverage

```bash
cd lark-todo-skill

# Basic tests (17 checks, quick validation)
bash evals/run_tests.sh

# Comprehensive tests (49 checks, full coverage)
bash evals/run_full_tests.sh

# Accelerator unit tests (16 pytest cases, offline shim — no Lark API calls)
python -m pytest evals/test_scan.py -v
```

| Test Group | Count | Coverage |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Step 0 bootstrap | 5 | bootstrap.sh detection, exit-code branches (0/2), Node-missing hints |
| Startup checks | 4 | config, auth, user info |
| Data sources | 8 | All 8 source commands |
| Two-route doc search | 3 | creator_ids + only_comment filters |
| Incremental scan | 3 | Different time ranges |
| Action commands | 15 | All 6 action types, param validation |
| Response structure | 6 | Key JSON field presence |
| Edge cases | 3 | Invalid params, permission checks |
| Meeting notes chain | 3 | vc +notes / +recording params |
| Accelerator pytest | 16 | scan.py command build, parallel exec, arg validation (shim-based) |

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights

- **Hybrid mode** — Runs on pure SKILL.md across every agent by default; when Python 3.8+ is available, automatically enables `scripts/scan.py` to collect all 8 data sources in one parallel pass; any accelerator failure falls back to pure SKILL.md without blocking the scan
- **Zero pip dependencies** — The accelerator only uses the Python standard library (`asyncio` + `subprocess` + `json`), no `pip install` required
- **Accelerate without re-judging** — The script only does "parallel scan + result normalization"; filtering, priority, deduplication, and actions still happen on the agent side, keeping behavior identical to pure SKILL.md mode
- **Self-contained** — Auth, permissions, command params all embedded, no dependency on other skills
- **Multi-org parallel scan** — Auto-discovers all profiles, parallel collection, cross-org merged sorting
- **Two-route doc search** — `creator_ids` for my docs + `only_comment` for @me comments
- **Smart priority** — Reasoning-based urgency ranking, not rigid scoring
- **Multi-agent compatible** — Works with any agent supporting the SKILL.md specification
